# warframe-afk-scripts
Collection of scripts used to afk in various missions of Warframe.

They've not been used for quite some time now, and some've been developed in different resolutions than others.
It's up to the user to change the coordinates of the script according to their own screen.

The use of bots and scripts to auto-play in warframe is bannable, even if their detection is pretty bland there's always a chance you'll mess up.
Don't play with these scripts if you don't understand this.
